                <p>To our amazing customers:

                    We have seen almost everything possible in 
                    our 103 years of service. That being said, 
                    we have no current plans to stop work in the 
                    office or on job sites. If the need should arise,
                    we will take immediate action to temporarily suspend 
                    work. We understand the importance of staying on schedule
                    for our projects but feel that the health and safety of our 
                    clients and employees must come first.</p>

            </div>
